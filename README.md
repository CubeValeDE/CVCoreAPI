# Core-API

This is CubeValeDE's internal Core-API. The API serves as a connection between our core system and the individual modules that extend the core system.
Developers mainly use this API to work with our systems because the functions of our systems can be addressed directly via this.

This is not the official CubeValeAPI for end users.
This is the internal CubeValeDE Core API, which can only be used by CubeValeDE developers.
